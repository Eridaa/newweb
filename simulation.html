        <strong>On Simulating in Architecture</strong>
        <br><br><br>
        <div>If one were to google simulation in architecture, a bunch of images with buildings, heatmaps and colourful streamlines would pop up. This approach of simulating digitally, seems to be deeply ingrained in the mind of most architecture professionals. </div>
        <br><br>
        <div>As I was reading  "Ways of Being" I stumbled on the Monte Karlo method, noted as one of the first examples of simulating in science. Having a look at how simulation has evolved in different disciplines, I have come to the conclusion that architects have in fact been simulating for quite some time now, and no, I am not talking about energy simulations. </div>
        <br><br>
        <div>The term simulation comes from the Latin root simulare, meaning “to imitate”. One does simulate or imitate, when it is not possible or feasible to observe the phenomenon of study in the real world. Nowadays structural engineers don’t wait for buildings to collapse, they test their structural integrity by simulating structural stresses beforehand. Similarly, building physicists are able to calculate heating and cooling energy needs of buildings by using thermodynamic modelling. All of these models are representations of the physical laws in the real world and able to imitate only to a certain extent. They assume structures behave in simple, predictable ways, but real buildings and bridges actually bend, twist, and respond in complex ways that these models don't accurately predict. </div>
        <br><br>
        <div>Digital simulation models of buildings are an invention of the last decades. The light tensile structures of Frei Otto did not come as a result of the development of finite element models, rather started from his ingenious physical experiments. Decades earlier in 1940, facing extreme flooding from the Mississippi river, engineers were able to come up with measures to reduce flood risk by building a physical model of the river basin. Today, in our standardised world, it seems that something that cannot be calculated in our virtual environments cannot be build in the real one. Lacaton & Vassal were struggling while trying to demonstrate the efficiency of winter gardens as thermal buffers in houses, because standard calculation models at the time, were not applicable and could not quantify their insulating effect. </div>
        <br><br>
        <div>This is not an urge to part ways with digital simulations. It is a reaction to the current narrative of seeing the future of simulation in architecture as a multi-model where different metrics such as sun radiation, daylight and energy get simulated; where one is expected to navigate and find the optimal solution. I do fear that that would be a mess of information and a dreadful thing to behold. A designer simulates everyday, in the home he dwells, in the places and buildings he visits, and lastly the models he makes and the spaces he builds. The nature of the profession lies in accumulating all this knowledge from lived experience. Digital simulations can only be an enrichment, if they are part of a holistic approach.</div>
        <br><br>
        <div>Reading about simulations done in the social sciences was a positive surprise for me. The prisoners dilemma for example is a game involving two players attempting to cooperate to receive a lighter sentence while facing a trial. The players can either stay silent or implicate the other. If they both stay silent their penalty gets reduced, however if there is only one accuser, he gets his freedom while the other one goes to jail. Multiplayer simulations show that the iteration of the game is likely to produce cooperation, some positive news for a change.</div>
        <br><br>
        <div>Experiments coming from the social sciences can serve as inspiration for drafting frameworks that can ‘predict’ the social success of the spaces and buildings we build. Going back to the Monte Karlo method ( where probable outcomes are based on the iteration of many samples) , could one ‘simulate’ how the daily lives of people from different age-groups, culture and genders get affected by changes in our physical environment? What kind of behaviour do our spaces support? Showing buildings with VR googles to clients is not a new thing, however I have not seen examples of using them as a test, as a design tool. </div>
        <br><br>
        <div>I was reading an interesting statement at “Ästhetik der Technik” today: “When engineers talk about function they usually refer to building performance, whereas architects usually mean the programmatic use of spaces.” Could simulation methods support and reassure us in the process of designing homes, schools, places we where we meet and gather, bridging the gab between designer and user? Can digital methods have a part in this? </div>
        <div>These are questions I still don’t have clear answers about.</div>
