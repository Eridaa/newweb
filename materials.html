        <strong>On natural materials in architecture</strong>
        <br><br><br>
        <div>This is a summary of my exploration about the current use of natural materials in construction. It is mostly based on building examples found in these books: Natural Building Materials, Constructive Disobedience and Building with Earth, so if you have the time skip this and go and read them. </div>
        <br>
        <div>By definition, natural materials are found in nature, produced in its construction-ready state with little or no human intervention. It comes as no surprise that as such, they exhibit great thermal qualities and can create healthy indoor environments. However, compared to cement, steel and other synthetic materials, they are not an allrounder, meaning that they shine under certain conditions and fail while subject to certain environmental constraints. Designing with them requires a good knowledge of how they react to environmental factors, local climate and time. These materials are ‘alive’, or better said, their lifecycles on earth are more attuned to our own, by contrast to much of the objects we like to surround ourselves with.</div>

        <strong>Earth</strong>
        <br>
        <div>Rammed earth was the first material, I was eager to learn more about. It’s a material that I don’t remember having witnessed, other than some buildings of Martin Rauch and Anna Heringer being featured in magazines and also vague memories of family conversations stigmatizing traditional albanian earth houses (unjustly so). </div>
        <div>The process consists of laying centimeter tall layers of earth in a formwork and pressing them. This does not need to be done on site, as these elements can be prefabricated and later on assembled. Wall thicknesses can span between 35, 45, 60 and even 100 centimeters, and usually in most of the examples that I have seen, rammed earth elements mostly constitute the envelope of the building since their load bearing capabilities are quite low. These walls ‘breathe’, as in are able to regulate indoor humidity levels. Exterior facing elements will change their appearance with time, during the first two winters some loss of material will happen until eventually it will reach a state of balance. In order to prevent this erosion which happens on the weather exposed surface, horizontal layers of usually lime mortar are placed at regular intervals, giving the facade its signature look. We must say that rammed earth is more successful in hot and arid climates. In colder climates it is a good thought to protect it from rain, and in most cases an additional layer of insulation is provided on the inside. </div>
        <div>There exist different variations of working with earth which not always involve formwork, for example the mixture of clay and straw can be piled up in sections and then cut to shape with a spade or other means (so-called cobwork). Not only walls can be made out of earth. Loam infills on floor structures such as earth-timber ceilings also exist (see Hortus -  Herzog de Meuron). The book “Building with Clay” is an encyclopedia in terms of all the different techniques out there.</div>
        <div>Apart from that, earth can also come in the form of dried clay bricks. The Big Brick Hybrid and jtB House by BLAF architekten are noteworthy examples of going beyond the traditional Flemish wall cavity system, using load bearing brick walls in conjunction with timber and concrete. You can read more about it in their paper titled “BIG BRICK HYBRIDS Learning by building beyond the mandate”, if you are looking after more nerdy details about brick buildings. </div>
        <div>In my opinion an Ode to Building with Earth, is the Wohnhaus in Schlins by Roger Boltshauser and Martin Rauch. Almost everything visible to the eye in the building is made of earth, rammed earth walls, rammed earth floors with vegetable based hot wax, fired earth for water resistant terraces and roofs, ornamental tiles with the raku technique, fine interior loam finishes with marmor powder. As if it could not be more sustainable already, the earth needed for the building was excavated from the slope it is situated in, a dream.</div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Straw</strong>
        <div>So, while I still look forward to have the chance to visit a rammed earth building in the future, I was surprised to actually see the wide extent to which on the other hand, straw is currently being used as an insulation material. The formula here seems to be wooden structural frames where straw is being pressed and cut, which can be prefabricated. For a sense of scale, we are talking about a straw layer of around 36 centimeters and more.  Since these elements are usually light, they can be transported then assembled on site with ease (at least that’s what I read). </div>
        <div>I believe most of us, when talking about straw, have this instant image of strawballs lying around in fields. If that’s the case, guess what, yes strawballs ( usually in the form of blocks) can be a building material too. At the Residence in Dornbirn by Georg Bechter, strawblocks with a thickness of 120 centimeters were used as exterior walls and roof insulation reaching a U value of 0.04 W/m2K (it’s a pretty good value). </div>
        <div>There is an elephant in the room however, that being the fact that straw burns easily. Because of this, in some countries regulations do not allow for the use of this material in buildings above a certain height or type. Hirner & Riehl were able to surpass that at Kloster Plankstetten by providing emergency exists for every floor, a fire detection system and encapsulating straw with loam renderings and gypsum boards. A similar more fire proof natural alternative can be hemp lime, which due to its low load bearing capabilities is usually combined with a wooden frame construction as well. Experiments done by CINARK have shown that the edition of clay to thatch can significantly improve its fire-proof capabilities, so the discussion of ensuring fire safety through sustainable ways is by no means over. </div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Timber</strong>
        <div>Making sure elements are fire resistant is also important in the case of timber, which usually means the application of fire resistant coatings and chemicals. Timber facades will alter their appearance with time and usually not in an uniform way, so pre-greying these elements with different tints and oils is usually the practice. Examples of buildings made only out of wood are rare, usually we are talking about cross laminated timber, glulam or different plywoods: wood veneers stacked and glued together. One noteworthy example that wilfully chose to leave any sort of glue out of the equation is Alterswohnsitz bei Bern by Meier Unger. The exterior walls consist of solid timber only and the ceiling beams are connected by dovetail joints requiring neither bolts, screws or nails. Another reason why this building is a favourite of mine, is the use of lime floors, and the meticulous research that the architects followed into working with lime mortar. We see less of use of lime mortar today and that is a shame. It is a  “healthy” material for finishes (according to myself and probably others), as long as you wear gloves while working with it. </div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Reed</strong>
        <div>I want to close this venture with the Conservation Centre on Lake Takern by Windgardhs. It offers a visually stunning example of using reed on the exterior of the building, quite similar to the Wadden Sea Centre by Dorte Mandrup built some years later. Again reed is not an allrounder, certain conditions have to be met for this to work, in this case a roof angle varying from 45 to 50° to ensure that the reed layer does not gather too much humidity. Based on traditional examples, its life-expectancy is estimated to be from 50 to 75 years. During this timeframe, this 28 centimeter thick layer of reed will change its appearance with the change of seasons and at the end of its lifecycle if no other use can be found for it, it will biodegrade and take the shape of something else. </div>
        <br><br>
        <dv>Natural materials offer great possibilities if sensibly placed. In our current economic system these materials do not represent the most viable financial option, hence we do not see much of them in our cities (at least I don’t). This is an urge for that to change.</dv>
