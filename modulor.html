        <strong>Spatial Representation of Human Perceptions</strong>
        <br><br><br>
        <div>I first started thinking about working on this topic when I was skimming through „Architektur Wahrnehmen“ (I would translate it as Perceiving Architecture) by K.L. Spengemann. As the title suggests the book includes essays and personal experiments, exploring how human beings perceive their surroundings, mostly focusing on vision. I was reminded of the fact that during the beginning of my studies the reason I started learning CAD software was the need for having a better „3 dimensional understanding“ of the spaces, I was designing. While as Juhani Pallasmaa notes, although designing with digital methods lacks in tactility and is not a haptic process, I believe it can be enriched by considering more than one layer of how a space can be  represented. </div>
        <br>
        <div>The following methods are some of my initial explorations while thinking about this topic.</div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Perception rose</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/mod1.gif" alt="Perception rose - EB" class="imEssay">
        <div style="color: lightgrey;">Perception rose - EB</div>
        <div>Which parts of the built environment do we see when we walk along the city? The perception rose is based on the isovist method and shows the vertical field of vision while walking. </div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Spatial perception in indoor environments</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/mod2.png" alt="Perception rose - EB" class="imEssay2">
        <img src="/images/mod3.png" alt="Perception rose - EB" class="imEssay2">
        <img src="/images/mod4.png" alt="Perception rose - EB" class="imEssay2">
        <div style="color: lightgrey;">Visualisations of human perceptions in indoor environments  - EB</div>
        <div>While being indoors, I believe that we start to perceive spaces more actively through our limbs. In this case I am considering hand reach as a guiding factor. Vertical field of vision further complements this analysis.</div>
        <br>
        <div>I believe both of these methods can help in better understanding the human scale of spaces during the design process. If you would like to try and know how to use grasshopper follow the example file here. </div>
