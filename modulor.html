        <strong>Spatial Representations of Human Perceptions</strong>
        <br><br><br>
        <div>I first started thinking about working on this topic when I was skimming through „Architektur Wahrnehmen“ (I would translate it as Perceiving Architecture) by K.L. Spengemann. As the title suggests the book includes essays and personal experiments, exploring how human beings perceive their surroundings, mostly focusing on vision. I was reminded of the fact that during the beginning of my studies I started learning CAD software, so that I would be able to have a better „3 dimensional understanding“ of the spaces I was designing. While as Juhani Pallasmaa notes, although designing with digital methods lacks in tactility and is not a haptic process, in my opinion, the digital holds the promise of providing a multitude of layers of how a space can be represented and can thus complement physical explorations. </div>
        <br>
        <div>The following methods are some of my initial explorations while thinking about this topic.</div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Perception Rose</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/mod1.gif" alt="Perception rose - EB" class="imEssay">
        <div style="color: lightgrey;">Perception rose - EB</div>
        <div>Which parts of the built environment do we see when we walk along the city? The perception rose is based on the isovist method and shows the vertical field of vision while walking. </div>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Perception Isobars</strong>
        <br>
        <img src="/images/mod2.gif" alt="Perception Isobars - EB" class="imEssay">
        <div style="color: lightgrey;">Perception Isobars  - EB</div>
        <div>When being indoors, I believe that we start to perceive spaces more actively through our limbs. In this case I am considering hand reach as a guiding factor. Vertical field of vision further complements this analysis.</div>
        <br>
        <div>I have gathered these methods as grasshopper user objects under the name of Modulor. Different to Le Corbusier's Modulor, it does not give a fixed set of harmonious values (Le Corbusier's blue and red series), but parametrically visualizes several body measures of different age groups.</div>
        <br>
        <div>The scripts are intentionally kept simple, to allow for customization, as I reckon that everyone has their personal design approach. For the ones who think, that these visual hints are helpful in understanding the scale of spaces, you can download the files <a href="https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/modulor" target="_blank">here.</a></div>
